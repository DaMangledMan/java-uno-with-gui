# UNO With a GUI Programmed in Java

## Overview

I began working on this project to further my understanding of the Java language.

I decided that a good project to start with would be the game of UNO. It has multiple moving parts and different interactions that can change the flow of the game.

Since I am brand new to Java I am following along with a 12 part tutorial on how to program UNO in Java. I am purposely not following it exactly and changing things when I think I can do a part better, but in all likelyhood my work will look very similar to the tutorial. In this case, all credit is to 'Code Clique'. Link to the tutorial: (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu_zq6omCvuQ_ZoKnE8-CE2nF113p9pxd) 

Eventually I would like to make the game of Munchkin as a website. Sadly Munchkin would be a very complicated game to program as it has many different cards that can completely change how the game works. I decided that Uno would teach me all the basic stuff about how a card game works and how to change the game flow with card effects.

Below is a link to a youtube video with more information about what I have learned so far.

## Development Environment

As stated before I made heavy use of a tutorial. I also used Gemini Code Assist to help me learn where I could and could not make the changes I was thinking of. It was all developed inside of Visual Studio Code.

Since the objective of this project is to learn Java, I only used Java while coding. A couple of packages that I used include the ArrayList and Random packages

## Future Work

- [ ] Game Framework: I will be learning and adding the gae framework for the UNO Experience next.
- [ ] GUI: Once the game framework is there, I will be creating a GUI to experience the game through.
- [ ] Moving the whole thing to a website format: Once I have learned all the different parts of how to make UNO and make it look pretty in a GUI, I will then teach myself how to import it into a website format.
